          Hi, I am <strong>Michele</strong>, I am an Italian Divemaster with
          200+ dives across 7 countries.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since I was a small kid, I have always had a great feeling with the
          water. üåä While on holiday with my family by the seaside, I would
          spend <strong>hours and hours in the water</strong>, refusing floats
          and swimming for as long as possible.
          <br />
          <br />
          Growing up in a small Sicilian village in the Parco dei Nebrodi, while
          competitive swimming was not accssible, my innate love for the ocean
          only grew.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2018, during a trip to Indonesia with my dear friend Angelo, we
          tried <strong>scuba diving for the first time</strong>. On our first
          dive we saw turtles, an octopus, a white-banded sea snake and vibrant
          marine life. üê¢üêô That day we promised ourselves to get certified.
          <br />
          <br />
          Months later in Koh Tao, Thailand, we became{" "}
          <strong>Open Water Divers</strong>. A few years later, together with
          Angelo and Melania, we travelled to Ustica and earned our{" "}
          <strong>Advanced certifications</strong>. By then, I knew I wanted to
          reach a professional level.
          <br />
          <br />
          In December 2024, I returned to Koh Tao to become a{" "}
          <strong>Rescue Diver</strong>. Six months later I started my{" "}
          <strong>Divemaster internship</strong> and finally became a Pro.
          <br />
          <br />
          These experiences grew my passion for{" "}
          <strong>marine life and conservation</strong>. I am now devoted to
          guiding divers, teaching respect for the ocean, and preserving it for
          future generations.
          <br />
          <br />
